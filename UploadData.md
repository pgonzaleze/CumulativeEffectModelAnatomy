In this tab the user will be able to upload files with their own data. 
* Note that when new dataseta are uploaded a new data source will overwrite all local changes and you will need to re-run your results.
    * Stressor response files, stressor magnitude files and watershed polygons must all be validated externally, or you will experience errors.
